# JS Variables:
---
## A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location
---
## Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign
---
## After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
---
## JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
---


```js
var x=10;

         var y=30;

         var z=x+y;

         document.write(z);

```
